    "\n",
    "#### Reason \n",
    "As we know if we use the cubic regression model given as $Y = β_{0} + β_{1}X^{1} + β_{2}X^{2} + β_{3}X^{3} + ϵ$ will overfit the data as it's flexibility is higher and it'll introduce unnecessery complexity and would produce noise as we have 100 observations only and linear regression would get better trained compared to cubic as cubic model would required more training data compared to the linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training RSS\n",
    "As a result of overfitting, the cubic regression model may fit the training data too closely, which will lead to a lower training RSS compared to the linear regression model. The cubic regression model could achieve a better fit to the training data set but it may not generalize well to new or unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, due to the higher complexity and potential overfitting associated with the cubic regression model $Y = β_{0} + β_{1}X^{1} + β_{2}X^{2} + β_{3}X^{3} + ϵ$ , we would expect the training RSS for the linear regression model to be lower than the training RSS for the cubic regression model for X and Y linear relationship."

    "The cubic regression model might capture unnecessary complexity that doesn't accurately represent the underlying structure of the data. This mismatch between the model complexity and the true relationship can lead to poor performance on test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overfitting\n",
    "The cubic regression model, with its higher complexity, has the capacity to fit the training data very closely, even capturing noise and random fluctuations. This overfitting phenomenon can lead to poor generalization to new, unseen data, such as the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalization to Test Data \n",
    "While the cubic regression model might perform very well on the training data (resulting in low training RSS), its performance on test data might not be good due to overfitting. The model might generalize poorly to new observations that do not adhere to the overfitted patterns captured in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Regression's Advantage\n",
    "The linear regression model, being simpler and more aligned with the true linear relationship, is less prone to overfitting. It is better able to capture the underlying linear trend in the data and generalize well to new observations, resulting in better performance on test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, if the test data follows the true linear relationship, we would expect the linear regression model to have lower test RSS compared to the cubic regression model. This is because the linear regression model is more likely to generalize well to new, unseen data without overfitting."
